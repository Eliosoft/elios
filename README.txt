Project Name : ArtNet-Remote
developed by : Jeremie GASTON-RAOUL

ArtNet Remote is a free GUI which allows you to send DMX values to ArtNet nodes.
Its goal is to help lighting technicians during installation and focus.

It is developed in Java, so it is compatible with Windows, Linux and Mac OS.
I haven't tested how to launch it on Windows Mobile yet...

Have fun !
