Installation
------------

### Requirements

The only requirement of Elios is a working Java 6 platform installation. You
can download a free copy of the Java Runtime on [java.com](http://java.com)

### Download and launch the installer

We provide two setups :

* the first one is a windows installer for the Microsoft Windows family

* the second is a universal installer that could be used on Microsoft Windows 
family, Linux and Mac OS.

After downloading the installer, you can launch it by double clicking on the setup file
or by the command line.

### Choose your langage

Elios is available in English and French. You have to choose one of them. Note that
the langage you choose will be used for the installer only. You will have to set 
the language on Elios too.
