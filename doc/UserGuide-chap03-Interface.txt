Elios Interface
---------------

There is 3 parts in Elios interface : tabs, panel and log line.
In the tabs part, you can choose between the differents panels (*Remote*, 
*Prefs*, *Logs* and *About*).
In the panel part, you access the panel linked to the selected tab.
In the Log line, you can read the last status log of the application.

Command Line
------------

![Remonte tab](pictures/elios/Elios-01-RemoteTab.png "Remote tab")

To manage circuits levels, Elios uses a simple a command line syntax.
Each line is a follow of simple commands (circuits at level sets) 
separated by a ";".

On the command line panel, you can find the following symbols :

* "0".."9" : numbers used to describe circuits (between 1 and 512), 
percent levels (between 0 and 100) or DMX values (prefixed by D, between 
0 and 255) ;

* "/" : used to describe an interval (if we type "1/5", circuits 
1,2,3,4,5 will be selected) ;

* "+" : used to add some circuits to previous selection (if we type 
"1+5", circuits 1 and 5 will be selected) ;

* "-" : used to remove some circuits to the previous selection (if we 
type "1/5-3", only circuits 1,2,4,5 will be selected) ;

* "@" : used between the selection of circuits and the level ("1/5@80" 
will set circuits 1,2,3,4,5 at a level of 80%) ;

* "F" : used to affect a full level to a selection of circuits ("1/5@F" 
will set circuits 1,2,3,4,5 at a 100% level) ;

* "D" : used to set level as DMX value ("1/5@D200" will set circuits 
1,2,3,4,5 at a 200 DMX value) ;
* ";" : used to separate simple commands ("1/5@50;7@80" will set 
circuits 1,2,3,4,5 at a 50% level and circuit 7 at a 80% level).

With this syntax, you can run quite touchy commands.
For example, if you type "1/5-4+10/12+7@80;20/24-21-23@D5", you will set 
1,2,3,5,7,10,11,12 at 80% and 20,22,23 at a 5 DMX value.
To run a command line, hit the "Enter" button. If you want to delete all 
the last char, hit "delete" and if you prefer to remove everything on 
the line, hit "reset".

Preferences
-----------

![Preferences tab](pictures/elios/Elios-02-PrefsTab.png "Preferences tab")

In the Prefs panel, you can set all application settings :

* *Language* : choose the language of Elios interface ;

* *Enable additive mode* : in additive mode, each new command line let 
unselected circuits in their previous state ; in non-additive mode, all 
circuits that are not selected are defaulted to 0% ;

* *DMX subnet* : select on which DMX Subnet the command is send ;

* *DMX universe* : select on which DMX Universe of the selected Subnet the 
command is send ;

* *Broadcast address* : the IP address on which ArtNet packets are 
broadcasted (use 127.255.255.255 if the node is on the same computer 
than Elios ; use 2.255.255.255 or 10.255.255.255 following IP addresses 
of the nodes on your network) ;

* *In Port* : the port on which Elios is listening the network (**do not use 
something else than 6454 if you don't know what you are doing**) ;

* *Out Port* : the port on which Elios is emetting the network (**do not use 
something else than 6454 if you don't know what you are doing**) ;

* *Start / Stop* : these buttons are used to start or stop Elios ArtNet 
server (you have to start the server before to send commands on the 
network) ;

* *Enable Http Server* : with the http server enabled, you can access 
Elios via your favorite web browser on any device device connected on 
the same network (just type http://2.0.0.1:8080 on your browser where 
2.0.0.1 is the ip of the computer running Elios and 8080 the Http port 
that has been set in the prefs panel) ;

* *Http port* : the port on which Elios http server is listening (default 
to 8080) ;

Logs
----

![Logs tab](pictures/elios/Elios-03-LogsTab.png "Logs tab")

On the logs panel you can see all the things that have been done in 
Elios : start and stop of server, parse of command line, errors 
encountered...
If you wand to clear the logs, just hit "Clear Logs" button.

About
-----

![About tab](pictures/elios/Elios-04-AboutTab.png "About tab")

That's just a simple panel displaying the names of people working on 
Elios and version number...
