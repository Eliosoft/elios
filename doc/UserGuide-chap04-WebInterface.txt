Elios Web Interface
===================

Elios Web Interface works exactly like the Elios Desktop Interface.
The only difference is that there are only 3 different panels (*Remote*, 
*Cues* and *DMX Table*) and the toolbar does not allow to switch to fullscreen.

To access it, you have to choose a port and enable web server in the Prefs panel 
of the Desktop interface. Then you just have to launch a web browser in any device 
connected to the same network and access to :
"http://ip_of_machine_with_desktop_interface:port_configured_in_prefs_panel"

When you change something in the Web Interface,
it's reflected in the Desktop interface, and vice versa.
